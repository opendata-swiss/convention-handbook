.. container:: Intro

   Conventions have the following goals:

   - Conventions prepare the next version of the DCAT-AP-CH
   - Conventions help to gradually make changes: by offering an old way and
     a new way to map metadata in parallel, so that datapublisher can chose
     themselves when to make the switch

   Overall the goal is for the DCAT-AP-CH and its implementation on opendata.swiss
   to be compliant to the DCAT-AP. This will be acchieved one convention at a time.
